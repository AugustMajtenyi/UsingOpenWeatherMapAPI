# UsingOpenWeatherMapAPI
This code uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve min/max temps from various locations

Get your free API key from https://openweathermap.org/

Download both the python file and the empty csv file in the same folder location. Add your API key to the api_key variable as a string, then run the program.
The result will be an array within temp.csv with various max/min temperatures from the different locations in the cities array. Then, the code uses pandas to create 2 plots to help vicualize some of the retrieved data.
